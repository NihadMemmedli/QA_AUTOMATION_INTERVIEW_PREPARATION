## Classes:

###### Definition: 

In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (often called fields or variables) and methods (functions that can be performed on objects of that class).

``` java
public class Car {
String brand;  // attribute/field
int speed;     // attribute/field

    void accelerate() {  // method
        speed += 10;
    }
}
```
## Components of a Class:

###### Fields: 

Variables that hold the state of the object.

###### Methods: 

Functions that define the behavior of the object.

###### Constructors: 

Special methods used to initialize new objects.

###### Inner classes: 

A class can contain another class.
Access Modifiers: Classes, their fields, and methods can have access modifiers like public, private, protected, which control the visibility and access levels of these members.

## Objects:

Definition: An object is an instance of a class. It's a real-world representation of a class.

``` java
Car myCar = new Car();  // 'myCar' is an object of class 'Car'
```        
#### Usage:

#### Setting Attributes:

``` java
myCar.brand = "Toyota";
myCar.speed = 0; 
```
#### Calling Methods:

``` java
myCar.accelerate();   // Increases speed by 10
```

## Lifecycle of an Object:

###### Creation:

Using the new keyword.
###### Use: 
Accessing/modifying fields and calling methods.
###### Destruction: 
In Java, objects are automatically destroyed when they are no longer referenced. This process is managed by the Garbage Collector.
###### Role of Classes and Objects in AQA:
Page Object Model (POM): One of the popular design patterns in test automation. Each web page or component is represented by a class, and the various elements and operations possible on that page are represented by the fields and methods of that class. Objects of these classes are created in the test scripts to interact with the web pages.


```java
public class LoginPage {
    WebElement usernameField;  // field representing an element
    WebElement passwordField;
    WebElement loginButton;

    public void login(String username, String password) {  // method to login
        usernameField.sendKeys(username);
        passwordField.sendKeys(password);
        loginButton.click();
    }
}
```

###### Test Data Management: 

Classes can represent different datasets or data configurations. Objects of these classes can store various test data scenarios.

###### Utilities and Helpers: 

Custom utility classes and their objects can be created to handle repetitive tasks like reading configuration, establishing database connections, or handling file operations.

## Conclusion:

Understanding the concept of classes and objects is fundamental in Java. In the context of AQA, they offer a structured way to model web pages, manage test data, and implement various utilities for effective test automation.
